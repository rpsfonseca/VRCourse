  title: 'The Persistence of Memory '
  painter: "Salvador Dal\xED"
  date: 1931
  description: "The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting
    pocket watch. It epitomizes Dal\xED's theory of \"softness\" and \"hardness\",
    which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Ad\xE8s wrote, \"The soft
    watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist
    meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order\""
